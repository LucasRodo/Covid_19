It's been a while since the covid-19 arrived, the virus has grown since then, being a person interested in technology and data science enthusiast, I want to analyze the passage of time of the virus, creating an interactive panel to visualize the situation of Covid-19 in the world.

## Data

The dataset that I used in this project is the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (Source: [Github](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)). This is probably one of the most comprehensive datasets publicly available about the Novel Coronavirus.
